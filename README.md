# Global Game Jam 2020 ReCycle - by Dmytro, Marty & Mark 
ReCycle is a collaborative game that encourages teamwork. This two player games challenges you to contruct refurbished bicycles using repaired parts. Conveyor belts bring bicycle frames with various missing parts. Parts bins provide various parts that have been repaired, to be added to the incomplete bikes. When you complete a bike, it will be wisked away by the delivery truck. If you cannot complete a bike in time, it will go into the ReCycle bin. The two players can & should share parts by passing them via the staging countertop. The two players work toward a shared goal, with a common scoring system. Xbox controllers are required, although one player can use keyboard, if desired. Left stick to move player X to pick up and drop B to run
